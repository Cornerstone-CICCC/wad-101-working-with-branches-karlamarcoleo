Once upon a time there lived 2 friends named Cassy and Katie. The world they lived in was getting attacked by many zombies. They were everywhere. Katie and Cassy ran into their tree house and hid in there for months. After a while they thought why not just go out and see how to world is now
A certain look in her eye and an easy smile. That was all they had from each other. 
They decided they were gonna live from art so they  created art crafts and they were crating art-crafts and music across their destinations.
